# Data-Wrangling
Data wrangling is a core skill that everyone who works with data should be familiar with since so much of the world's data isn't clean.</br>
Data wrangling is the Process of Gathering, Assessing and Cleaning Data before analysing it, visualisation or build predictive models using machine learning.

**Dataset**
TI am going to wrangle  a dataset of 19,000 online job posts from 2004 to 2015 that were posted through an Armenian human resource portal. It is hosted on Kaggle.

## Properties of Data
1. **Quality**:  Low quality data is commonly referred to as dirty data. Dirty data has issues with its content.
    - Common data quality issues include:
      1. Missing data
      2. Invalid data
      3. Inaccurate data
      4. Inconsistent data

2. **Tidiness**: Untidy data is commonly referred to as "messy" data. Messy data has issues with its structure.</br>
